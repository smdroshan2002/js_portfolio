CSS for layout and presentation, JavaScript to add behavior. Type in the input field to add more tasks using "Add". There is a delete button (“✗”) for each task and the possibility to line-through the text by doing it. This method saves current tasks in the file using saveData() function, then shows them when called by showTask(), which provided a seamless user experience.

                    Here is a login form which I developed using HTML, CSS, and JS which is efficient and easily manageable by the user. The form has isolation for the username and password, a check box labeled “Remember Me,” and a “Login” button. The look and feel of the design is quite good with a backdrop-filter applied to the form and good transitions for the input labels and buttons. Facebook and Google options are included for Social login which provides ease of use. The chosen form is neat and minimalist with an incomprehensible background and no unnecessary details, which guarantees modernity as well as practicability. This login form can find application with any web based application that is in need of user authentication.
